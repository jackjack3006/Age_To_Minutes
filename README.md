# Age_To_Minutes
One of the first apps I built where I learnt to use buttons, get information from the user and to convert them to the fomrat I want and use them accordingly.
Here in this app we can choose a date, preferably our birth date, so that we can see how many minutes it has been since we were born. It is precise to the day as I have not considered the time.
The app design is pretty mediocre as it was one of my first projects. It can run on all android version from Android Kitkat or API 16.
Hope you guys enjoy the app and if there are any suggestions that you wish that I add, please let me know.
